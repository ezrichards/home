# home
A desktop home landing page application. 

## What is this?

I thought it would be interesting to make a desktop application using
[ElectronJS](https://www.electronjs.org) which provides a lot of information
in one spot, so I made this "landing page" application.

## Layout
The layout of this application is "squares" which all have useful information. 
I put some news and weather API data in there, but this system should be easily adapable 
to add more data of choice.
